  m: Thanks, Ozlo. I'm feeling really frustrated with Sheila lately.
- s: agent
  m: I'm sorry to hear that, John. Would you like to talk about it?
- s: user
  m: Yeah, I just feel like she's always putting her needs first and not considering how it affects me and the kids.
- s: agent
  m: It's understandable that you feel frustrated. Have you tried having a conversation with Sheila about how you feel and the impact her actions have on you and the kids?
- s: user
  m: I've tried, but it usually just leads to an argument. I don't know what else to do.
- s: agent
  m: It might be helpful to approach the conversation from a place of empathy and understanding. Instead of focusing on what she's doing wrong, try to express your own feelings and the impact on you and the kids in a non-confrontational way.
- s: user
  m: That's a good idea. I'll try to have a more open and empathetic conversation with her.
- s: agent
  m: Remember that effective communication is key in any relationship, even with an ex-partner. Take a deep breath and stay calm during the conversation. You might find that you can reach a better understanding and improve the co-parenting situation for everyone involved.

  m: You're welcome, John. I'm here to help. If you need any more assistance or someone to talk to, don't hesitate to reach out.
